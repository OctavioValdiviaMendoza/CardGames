## How the Game Works

Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get as close to **21** as possible without going over.
Thirteen is a card game where the goal is to play all your cards before the other player.
War is a card game where you go head to head to see which card is higher.

### Blackjack Basic Rules
- Number cards are worth their face value
- Face cards (**Jack, Queen, King**) are worth **10**
- **Ace** can count as **1 or 11**
- The player starts with two cards
- The dealer also starts with two cards
- The player can choose to:
  - **Hit** → draw another card
  - **Stand** → keep their current hand
- The dealer draws cards until reaching at least **17**
- The winner is the hand closest to **21** without busting

### Thirteen Basic Rules
- Order of cards goes: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King Ace 2
- Order of suits goes Spades Clubs Diamonds Hearts
- Both players start with 13 cards
- The player can choose to:
  - **Pass** → Pass their turn
  - **Play** → Play the selected cards
- The player must make a combination of either:
  - Singles 
  - Doubles
  - Triples
  - A sequence
- The winner is the first player to empty their hand.

### War Basic Rules
- Number cards are worth their face value
- Face cards (**Jack, Queen, King**) are worth the same.
- Each player draws one card
- The winner is whoever has the highest card.
